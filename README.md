# üåê Social Media Comment System

With the rapid growth of social media platforms, users are posting millions of photos, videos, and other content every minute. Engaging with this content, users respond through **likes**, **shares**, and **comments** on posts. While the commenting feature may appear simple, creating a well-rounded, interactive comment system requires robust logic and planning, as it involves multiple sub-features working seamlessly together.

## ‚ú® Key Features of the Comment System

- **Commenting on the Post**: Users can share their thoughts or feedback on the original post.
- **Replying to Comments**: Allows users to reply not only to the original comments but also to any nested replies, creating threaded conversations.
- **Deleting Comments**: Users can delete their own comments, and the UI will handle updates to reflect the deletion smoothly.
- **Liking and Disliking Comments**: Users can express their approval or disagreement with specific comments, providing feedback on individual statements.
- **Showing/Hiding Replies**: To keep the UI clean and organized, users can expand or collapse replies under each comment as needed.
- **Additional Functionalities**: Many more features can be added to enhance the commenting experience, including timestamps, comment editing, and moderation controls.

This application brings together all these elements in a realistic, interactive comment system that simulates the complexity of a real-world social media platform.
